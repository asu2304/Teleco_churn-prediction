# Telecom Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom industry using machine learning techniques. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers leaving a company's services or canceling their subscriptions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about telecom customers and various features that may influence churn behavior. It includes attributes such as customer demographics, usage patterns, service plan details, and customer churn status.

The dataset can be found here in this repo itself.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build machine learning models to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. The following steps were followed in the analysis:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset was explored, and necessary preprocessing steps were performed, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation.

2. Model Building: Several classification models were trained on the preprocessed data. The models used include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree.

3. Model Evaluation: The trained models were evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of each model was analyzed to identify the most accurate and reliable model for predicting customer churn.

## Results

The model achieved a high accuracy of 97% and a recall value of 100% in predicting customer churn. These results indicate that the model can effectively identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive measures to retain them.

## Usage
